<h1 align=center>Codex Themes</h1>

This repository contains the built-in themes for articles on the Codex Press publishing platform. For information on how to 
use these themes with articles on Codex, please see the [full documentation] on the platform.

The bird-named themes are all derivatives from the basic theme and are made by overriding LESS variables, thus keeping
specificity low in the resulting CSS. If you're just looking to change a few things like fonts and colors, you can include
`themes/basic` in your article with a little custom CSS. If you're working on a bigger project, you may want to copy the
files from lib `themes/basic`.
